# API Automation Framework

## Description

This is a **Java-based API Automation Framework** designed for validating RESTful APIs. It leverages **RestAssured** for API interactions and **TestNG** for test execution and assertions. The framework follows best practices to ensure scalability, reusability, and maintainability for real-world testing needs.

This framework is ideal for Automation Testers and QA professionals preparing for interviews or looking to implement API automation in real-time projects. It supports various HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE) and helps automate test cases for functional validation of APIs.
